Conduct soil test to assess fertility, pH levels,etc. Plan the layout of your orchard. Provide adequate irrigation. Apply organic mulch around newly planted tree. Monitor health of plants regularly."
"How much water do fruit trees need, and how often should I irrigate?","Every fruit tree is different, but in general, you should water weekly the first year they're in the ground. Many fruit trees below require what's called a “deep soak” which generally requires 40 minutes of watering to reach depths of 12-24 inches. Watering may also depend on the soil they're planted in."
What are the signs of nutrient deficiency in plants?,"Nutrient deficiency symptoms occur as yellowing of leaves, interveinal yellowing of leaves, shortened internodes, or abnormal coloration such as red, purple, or bronze leaves. These symptoms appear on different plant parts as a result of nutrient mobility in the plant."
What are the several pruning techniques?,"Several pruning techniques include: 1.Thinning: This technique involves the selective removal of entire branches or limbs to reduce the density of the tree's canopy. By thinning, you allow more sunlight and fresh air to penetrate the inner portions of the tree, fostering better fruit production and reducing disease risk.  2.Heading Back: Heading back refers to trimming the tips of branches to stimulate branching and new growth. It's especially useful for young trees, enabling you to shape them as desired and encourage a strong structure.3.Pinching: Pinching involves gently nipping off the tips of young shoots using your fingers. It's an effective method for managing excessive vegetative growth and directing the tree's energy towards fruit production.  4.Renewal Pruning: For older trees, consider removing older, unproductive branches to make way for new, vigorous growth. This technique helps breathe new life into ageing trees."
How do I know when fruits are ready for harvest?,Check whether tree fruits such as apples and pears are ready by cupping a fruit in the palm of your hand and twisting gently.
